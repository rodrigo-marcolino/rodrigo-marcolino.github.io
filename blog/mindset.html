        <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Learn about neuroplasticity and growth mindset was a watershed in my journey as a student. Now I am sure that
          our intelligence and talents can be developed over time. There is a ton of research on the topic already.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I must admit that I Had a Fixed Mindset and looking back now I think about how my life could be
          different if I knew about that before.
        </p>
        <h2>Comparing how I was then, to how I am now.</h2>

          <div class="column-left header"><h3>Fixed Mindset</h3></div>
          <div class="column-right header"><h3>Growth Mindset</h3></div>
          <div class="column-left">I Believed that intelligence, talents, and other abilities are fixed</div>
          <div class="column-right">I Believe that intelligence can be improved and Embracing lifelong learning</div>
          <div class="column-left">I Avoided challenges to prevent the possibility of failure</div>
          <div class="column-right">I Believe that failures are just temporary setbacks</div>
          <div class="column-left">I hid the flaws so I wouldn't be judged by others</div>
          <div class="column-right">I Willingly embrace challenges</div>
          <div class="column-left">I gave up easily</div>
          <div class="column-right">I Put in more effort to learn</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          I have a negative inner voice that acts against a growth mindset. Now I am Trying to flip thoughts such as ‘I
          can’t do this’, to <em class="tag">‘I can do this if I keep practicing’</em> to nurture a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>I am learning how hard work, good strategies, and good use of resources lead to better learning.</p>

            the hallmark of the growth mindset.”
