        <p>Let's start with a definition:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Problem solving refers to cognitive processing directed at achieving a goal when the problem solver does not
            initially know a solution method. A problem exists when someone has a goal but does not know how to achieve
            it. Problems can be classified as routine or nonroutine, and as well defined or ill defined. The major
            cognitive processes in problem solving are <i>representing, planning, executing, and monitoring.</i>

        <p>
          Definitely Learning how to define a problem, break it into manageable parts, and work toward a solution it is
          a core skill to become a Software Developer. We will find in almost all job descriptions for developers the
          skill "problem solving".
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, we could reach the conclusion that we must have this skill in order to be a developer.
          Probably you are asking you self, "Do I have this skill? Can I learn it?".
        </p>

        <h2>Steps for Problem Solving</h2>
        <p>
          <b>1. Read the problem as many times as necessary to obtain a clear understanding of the problem</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>2. Work through the problem with sets of sample data</b></p>
        <p><b>3. Simplify and optimize your steps</b></p>
        <p><b>4. Write pseudocode</b></p>
        <p><b>5. Translate pseudocode into code and debug</b></p>
        <p><b>6. Simplify and optimize your code</b></p>
