        <h2>What is my long term goal and/or Career Pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My long-term goal to become a successful and proficient T-Shaped
          Developer.
        </p>

        <h2>
          A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
          learning
        </h2>
        <p>
          I can say that my main strength is that I do love the process of
          learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          My biggest limitation is that I always find myself trying to learn
          about too many things at once. consequently, I tend to not spend
          enough time practicing the fundamentals of a specific subject.
        </p>

        <h2>
          What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at EDA?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Due to my lack of English proficiency. My communication skills have
          been drastically reduced, and I see here at EDA a great opportunity to
          improve my communication skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Workload Management:</h2>

        <p>
          - EDA has provided an excellent study plan, and I'll stick to it.
          <br />
          - I'll Divide the work into chunks that have a beginning and an end.
          <br />
          - Keep my focus on a whole section or topic each time. <br />
          - I will utilise Toggle to keep track of time spent on activities.
          with 25 minutes spent working followed by a five-minute break. <br />
        </p>
        <h2>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
          In Case that I'm feeling like I'm not making any progress, I'll ask
          for help. EDA has provided a slack Channel that allows us to get the
          support we need.
