        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence focuses on the personal skills of a human, an
          individual who is emotionally intelligent comes forth as an extremely
          persuasive and productive human being, as a person who manages to get
          everything that he wants. Said person can also keep his cool which
          makes him a great negotiator.
        </p>
        <p>
          These set of skills include impulse control, persistence,
          self-motivation, empathy, social deftness and self-awareness. 
        </p>
        <h2>Emotions are critical to our lives.</h2>
        <p>
          Do our emotions hold us back? Would we do better if we were
          emotionless and logical?
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotions are important to us because they help us live satisfying
          lives. One way emotions do this is by helping us learn from our
          memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our brains store experiences in a way that not only records facts, but
          also our feelings. For example, if a little boy touches a hot stove
          and feels the pain of it, he will remember that feeling should he
          touch another stove again. His emotions will help him to learn from
          his experience and keep him away from touching stoves again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emotions help us understand others’ feelings, which can allow us to
          predict their actions. For example, if a man is angry and has clenched
          fists or a loud voice, you will know his emotional state. You can
          therefore predict his future actions; he might be ready to hit
          someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotions also drive us to action. If we feel threatened, for example,
          our emotions will kick in and prepare us to react quickly if the
          threat becomes real.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a certain point, people lose the capacity to feel emotions and
          no longer act like they used to. They tend to do nothing at all, which
          has been observed in patients who have had their heads cut open for
          brain surgery called lobotomy. As a result of it, they can’t feel or
          perceive any emotion.
        </p>
        <h2>Emotions can sometimes be a hindrance to our judgment.</h2>
        <p>
          Emotions are important tools for dealing with the world around us, but
          they can also lead to mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are emotional, it’s harder to think clearly. We can only
          process so much at once and our minds become overloaded with thoughts
          that aren’t rational or helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you might overreact to situations when you’re frightened.
          For instance, if there’s a sheet on the washing line that looks like a
          ghost, you can mistake it for one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way our emotions get the best of us is when we act before
          thinking things through. When information enters our brain, it first
          goes to an area that isn’t responsible for rational thought – the
          emotional part of the brain. If this part perceives a threat, it can
          cause us to act without consulting with our rational mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why you might be startled when you’re walking through a forest
          and notice something strange out of the corner of your eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three ways that our emotions can lead us to act
          irrationally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our brains are wired to think in the present based on past
          experiences. For example, a boy who was physically bullied at school
          may grow up to be a strong man, but still feel threatened by his
          former bully.
        </p>
        Emotions are important, but they can sometimes cloud our judgment and
        make us irrational. Therefore we need to find a way to control them so
        that we can think clearly.

            that feels. "
