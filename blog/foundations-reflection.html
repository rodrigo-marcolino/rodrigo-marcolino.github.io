        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          learning how to code requires time and persistence. And learn about a Growth Mindset had a greater impact on
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many times throughout the program that I got stuck on some tasks, and it leads to questioning my
          ability to learn to program and remind me that with persistence I will get there. Struggling with something is
          growth, all that matters is that I have the tenacity to see it through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Procrastination is the biggest problem in my learning progress. I learned that track my time is essential for
          my learning progress. I noticed that When I used to spend a whole day studying on the computer, I end up my
          day thinking that I studied for around 10 hours. However, when I start to use the Pomodoro Technique for
          managing my time to stay focused. I discovered that at the end of a productive day I got something around 4
          and 5 hours in focus mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning about Emotional intelligence I figure out that I’m the kind of person who avoids at all costs
          expressed my emotions and I have to overcome that for my wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychologists are basically in agreement that avoiding or inhibiting unpleasant emotions or suppressing your
          thoughts makes your body tense, your mood negative, and your cognition impaired. But if you access, express,
          and process those blocked-up emotions, you’ll feel better, in all the ways.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
          self-awareness promotes emotional wellness and self-esteem. consequently, it provides an insight into who we
          are, why we react as we do, and gives us direction for self-improvement. I see Self-awareness is an important
          skill to outcome during the learning process. It gives us the belief in our ability to achieve a goal.
        </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Be convinced that hard work, good strategies, and good use of resources will lead to learning anything that I
          want.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The most frustrating feature of writing as a non-native English speaker is that you can’t express yourself as
          clearly as you can when using your mother-tongue. You are thinking about something fairly complex, but you
          can’t explain it with that specific semantic nuance.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
          development bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p>Learning to code is not easy at all. We need the right mindset and emotional intelligence to achieve it.</p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h3>
        <p>Not all. it’s helping me now and as well for my future challenges</p>

        <h3>Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>If I just used my time practising programming, sooner or later I would find myself in one of these situations: Stuck, unmotivated, thinking that I'm not smart enough, anxious, and so on.
          Everything that I  learned during the core learning helped me to overcome those problems.
